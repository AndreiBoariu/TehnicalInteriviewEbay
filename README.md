I've got a simple app which needed to be updated

_Implement a new screen that will display:_

title
earthquake's location on the map
magnitude
date
...


_Implement filter by continent_

use continent query parm, for example https://barfooz.net/earthquakes?continent=europe

**Available endpoints:**

https://barfooz.net/earthquakes

https://barfooz.net/earthquakes/id

https://barfooz.net/earthquakes?continent=europe

https://barfooz.net/continents
